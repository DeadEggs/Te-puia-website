                        We have be open sents 1963 but the history of are land 
                        is much older<br>
                        Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa 
                        Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the 
                        area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, 
                        emerged from the earth’s core while trying to find their 
                        brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount 
                        Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking for their 
                        brother, they left part of the fire they carried, 
                        creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating 
                        the geothermal activity that remains today.

                            At the National Weaving school, students are 
                            taught the skills and traditions of a craft 
                            hundreds of years old. “I believe weaving can only 
                            be learnt the old way - by sitting, by listening, 
                            by touching and by doing,” says head of the 
                            weaving school, Edna Pahewa.
