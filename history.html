                        Weapons Before Europe
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in 
                        Aotearoa, Māori warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand 
                        combat. Warriors used many different hand weapons, 
                        including taiaha (fighting staffs), pouwhenua (pointed 
                        staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao (short 
                        spears), huata (long spears) and patu (clubs). The long 
                        weapons were carried, and the small clubs were often 
                        tucked into a belt. Special weapons were sometimes given 
                        names and passed down through generations

                        Geysers
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa 
                        Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the 
                        area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, 
                        emerged from the earth’s core while trying to find their
                        brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount 
                        Tongariro. As they rose to the surface looking for their
                        brother, they left part of the fire they carried, 
                        creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating 
                        the geothermal activity that remains today.

                        Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big 
                        splash” and erupts up to heights of 30 meters.<br> 
                        To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is 
                        the “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after 
                        Prince Edward Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was 
                        traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually 
                        plays 10 mins before and then simultaneously with Pohutu
                        and reaches heights of up to seven metres (almost 23 
                        feet).<br>
                        The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the 
                        blackened crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The 
                        fan-shaped jet can reach heights of up to 15 metres 
                        (just over 49 feet). It is named after the New Zealand 
                        Pigeon.<br>
                        According to Maori culture, 
                        geysers are viewed as gifts from the gods
